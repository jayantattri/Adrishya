# AI Agent Streaming Guide

## Overview

The AI agent now supports real-time streaming of responses in the terminal. This means you can see the AI's reasoning process, tool executions, and progress updates as they happen, rather than waiting for the complete response.

## How It Works

When you use the `:ai-agent-ask` command, the system now:

1. **Shows real-time progress** - You'll see updates like "Starting AI analysis..." and "Iteration 1/3"
2. **Displays reasoning** - The AI's thinking process is shown as it happens
3. **Shows tool executions** - Each tool call is displayed with its parameters and results
4. **Provides status updates** - Success/failure messages for each step

## Example Output

Here's what you'll see when running `:ai-agent-ask "open github.com"`:

```
ðŸ¤– Processing: open github.com
ðŸ“Š Starting AI analysis...
ðŸ“Š Analyzing query...

ðŸ§  REASONING:
   The user wants to navigate to GitHub. I need to use the navigate tool
   to open the GitHub website in the browser.

ðŸ”§ Executing: navigate
   Parameters: {'url': 'https://github.com'}
âœ… navigate: Navigation successful

ðŸ“Š Task completed successfully!
ðŸŽ‰ Task completed successfully!
```

## Streaming Update Types

The streaming system provides several types of updates:

- **`progress`** - General progress updates
- **`thinking`** - AI reasoning and analysis
- **`tool_call`** - When a tool is about to be executed
- **`tool_result`** - Results of tool execution
- **`error`** - Error messages

## Technical Implementation

### Streaming Wrapper

The streaming functionality is implemented through a `StreamingAgentWrapper` class that wraps any AI agent and adds streaming capabilities:

```python
from streaming_agent import create_streaming_agent

# Create streaming wrapper
streaming_agent = create_streaming_agent(your_agent)
streaming_agent.set_streaming_callback(your_callback)

# Process with streaming
response = await streaming_agent.process_query_with_streaming(query)
```

### Callback Function

The streaming callback function receives updates in real-time:

```python
def streaming_callback(update_type: str, content: str, **kwargs):
    if update_type == "thinking":
        print(f"ðŸ§  {content}")
    elif update_type == "tool_call":
        print(f"ðŸ”§ Executing: {kwargs.get('tool_name')}")
    # ... handle other update types
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience** - Users can see what's happening in real-time
2. **Debugging** - Easier to diagnose issues when you can see each step
3. **Transparency** - Full visibility into the AI's decision-making process
4. **Progress Tracking** - Know how far along the process is

## Testing

You can test the streaming functionality using the test script:

```bash
cd ai_agent_tools
python test_streaming.py
```

This will show you a mock example of how the streaming works.

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see streaming output:

1. **Check agent initialization** - Make sure the AI agent is properly initialized
2. **Verify callback setup** - Ensure the streaming callback is properly configured
3. **Check for errors** - Look for any error messages in the output

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the streaming system:

- **WebSocket streaming** - Real-time updates in the browser UI
- **Progress bars** - Visual progress indicators
- **Detailed timing** - Execution time for each step
- **Interactive controls** - Ability to pause/resume execution
