# Reasoning Separation Guide for DeepSeek R1 14B

## üß† Understanding Reasoning Models

The DeepSeek R1 14B model is a **reasoning model** that thinks through problems step by step before taking action. This is different from traditional models that give direct responses.

### What is Reasoning?
- **Thinking Process**: The model analyzes the problem, considers options, and plans its approach
- **Step-by-Step Logic**: It breaks down complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Decision Making**: It explains why it chooses certain actions over others
- **Context Understanding**: It considers the current browser state and user needs

### Why Separate Reasoning from Actions?
1. **Clarity**: Users can see the AI's thought process
2. **Transparency**: Understand why certain actions are taken
3. **Debugging**: Easier to troubleshoot when things don't work as expected
4. **Learning**: Users can learn from the AI's reasoning approach
5. **Trust**: Builds confidence in the AI's decision-making

## üîß How It Works

### Before (Mixed Response)
```
User: "Help me research Python frameworks"
AI: "I'll help you research Python frameworks. Let me think about this... 
     I need to open multiple websites, search for information, compare features...
     Opening Django documentation... Opening Flask documentation..."
```

### After (Separated Response)
```
User: "Help me research Python frameworks"

üß† REASONING:
I need to help the user research Python frameworks. This involves:
1. Opening multiple documentation websites
2. Extracting key information from each
3. Comparing features and capabilities
4. Providing a comprehensive summary

‚úÖ ACTION:
I'll open Django and Flask documentation in separate tabs, then extract 
key information about their features, performance, and use cases.

üîß Tools used:
1. open_url: Django documentation
2. open_url: Flask documentation
3. get_page_info: Extract content
```

## üéØ Response Structure

The AI agent now provides responses in this structure:

### 1. Reasoning Section (üß†)
- **What**: The AI's thought process and analysis
- **Why**: Explains the reasoning behind decisions
- **How**: Describes the approach to solving the problem

### 2. Action Section (‚úÖ)
- **What**: The actual actions to be taken
- **Tools**: Which browser tools will be used
- **Plan**: Step-by-step execution plan

### 3. Execution Section (üîß)
- **Tools Used**: List of browser tools executed
- **Results**: Success/failure of each action
- **Summary**: Overall outcome

## üìã Example Interactions

### Example 1: Simple Navigation
```
User: "open github.com"

üß† REASONING:
The user wants to navigate to GitHub. This is a straightforward request
that requires opening a URL in the browser. I should use the open_url
tool to navigate to github.com.

‚úÖ ACTION:
Opening GitHub in the current tab.

üîß Tools used:
1. open_url: github.com
```

### Example 2: Complex Research Task
```
User: "help me research AI tools by opening GitHub and searching for 'AI browser automation'"

üß† REASONING:
The user wants to research AI tools, specifically focusing on AI browser automation.
This is a multi-step task that requires:
1. Opening GitHub in a new tab
2. Using the search functionality
3. Finding relevant repositories
4. Extracting key information

I should use the open_url tool to navigate to GitHub, then use search_page
to find relevant content.

‚úÖ ACTION:
I'll open GitHub in a new tab and search for "AI browser automation" to find
relevant repositories and tools.

üîß Tools used:
1. open_url: github.com (new tab)
2. search_page: "AI browser automation"
```

### Example 3: Form Automation
```
User: "find the contact form and fill it with my email"

üß† REASONING:
The user wants me to locate and fill out a contact form on the current page.
This requires:
1. Analyzing the page content to find form elements
2. Identifying input fields (name, email, message)
3. Filling in the appropriate information
4. Potentially submitting the form

I need to use get_page_info to analyze the page structure, then use
fill_form to populate the fields.

‚úÖ ACTION:
I'll analyze the current page to find the contact form, then fill in
the email field with the user's email address.

üîß Tools used:
1. get_page_info: Analyze page structure
2. fill_form: Fill email field
```

## üöÄ Using the Enhanced Agent

### Method 1: Load Commands
```
:pyeval --file ai_agent_tools/load_ai_agent.py
:ai-agent-init deepseek_assistant
:ai-agent-ask "help me research Python frameworks"
```

### Method 2: Direct Python Usage
```
:pyeval --file ai_agent_tools/use_ai_agent.py
await agent.ask("help me research Python frameworks")
```

### Method 3: Test Reasoning Separation
```
:pyeval --file ai_agent_tools/test_reasoning_separation.py
```

## üé® Customizing the Reasoning

### Adjusting Reasoning Depth
You can modify the reasoning prompt in `ai_browser_agent.py`:

```python
def _create_reasoning_system_prompt(self, tools: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> str:
    prompt = f"""You are an AI browser assistant that helps users with web automation tasks.
    
    INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. First, think through the user's request step by step
    2. Provide your reasoning in a "THINKING:" section
    3. Then provide your action plan in an "ACTION:" section
    4. Finally, execute the tools in an "EXECUTE:" section
    
    # Add your custom instructions here
    """
    return prompt
```

### Controlling Reasoning Output
You can adjust how much reasoning is shown:

```python
# Show full reasoning
if response.thinking:
    print(f"üß† REASONING: {response.thinking}")

# Show only action
print(f"‚úÖ ACTION: {response.message}")

# Show only tools
if response.tool_calls:
    print(f"üîß Tools: {len(response.tool_calls)}")
```

## üîç Debugging with Reasoning

### Understanding Failures
When something doesn't work, the reasoning helps you understand why:

```
‚ùå Error: Failed to open website

üß† REASONING:
I attempted to open the website using the open_url tool, but the URL
was invalid or the website was unreachable. I should have validated
the URL format first.

‚úÖ ACTION:
I'll try to open a valid URL and provide better error handling.
```

### Improving Performance
The reasoning shows you how the AI approaches problems:

```
üß† REASONING:
For this research task, I could either:
1. Open multiple tabs and search each site individually
2. Use a single search engine and filter results
3. Use specialized research tools

I chose option 1 because it provides more comprehensive results
and allows for better comparison between sources.
```

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific in Requests
```
‚úÖ Good: "help me research Python web frameworks by opening their documentation"
‚ùå Vague: "research Python frameworks"
```

### 2. Break Complex Tasks
```
‚úÖ Good: "open reddit.com in a new tab"
‚úÖ Good: "scroll down to see more posts"
‚ùå Complex: "browse reddit and find interesting posts"
```

### 3. Provide Context
```
‚úÖ Good: "on the current page, find the search box"
‚ùå Vague: "find the search box"
```

### 4. Be Patient
- Reasoning models take time to think through problems
- Complex tasks may take 10-30 seconds
- The thinking process is valuable for understanding the approach
